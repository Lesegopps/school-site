            <summary>School Governing Body (SGB)</summary>
            <p>The SGB is a legislatively mandated entity under the South African Schools Act 84 of 1996, the National Education Policy Act 27 of 1996 and the Basic Education Laws Amendment Act 32 of 2024 amongst others. <br>
            It is the government of the school, making crucial decisions regarding the philosophies, policies, codes and regulations of our school <br> It is obliged to promote and advance the interests of the school, support the everyday functioning of the school, control the school's property, promote volunteerism, have input on appointing employees and determining conditions justifying opening the school up to the community <br> It consists of the following roles: <br>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Chairperson:</strong> Mr. Leadership</li>
                <li><strong>Secretary:</strong> Mr. Secretary</li>

            <summary>Volunteerism</summary>
            <p>One of the responsibilities of the SGB is to promote volunteering. We hold the belief in community, thus are willing to open our doors to individuals seeking to assist the school in various roles and departments. <br> The SGB not only assesses individuals to judge their suitability for the role, but may also accept such work as evidence of their competence should an opportunity in that role, or a similar one, arise. <br> Of course, great care is taken to ensure that volunteers do not present any harm, potential or otherwise, to the school, its management and above all else, the learners. <br> Qualified and unqualfied individuals are invited to consult the SGB or School Management Team regarding such opprtunity to network, gain practical workplace experience, and help foster the best.  </p>

            <summary>Donations</summary>
            <p>In the spirit of giving, our school accepts and provides doantions of various kinds  in the name of education and humanity. Perhaps our proudest endeavour is havign a "lost and found" wherein unclaimed stationery, clothing and such are donated to learners in need of them. Our school also accepts donations and contributions from external stakeholders who have supprted our cause. We are eternally grateful for every hand that helps us provide the most conducive environment for the development of our learners. <br> Should your require more information regarding our donation programmes and how you can participate, please<a href="Contacts.html">click here</a></p>

            <summary>Open-gate policy</summary>
            <p>As an expression of our desire to be intimately linked to the community, our school's gates are always open. Not necessarily in a literal sense, but that our school  is open to members of the community having direct, walk-in interactions with the school staff- teachers and school management alike. Although appointments would be ideal, our staff is open to attending the needs of the our community members as immediate as they arise. Consulting a member of the school governing body or the school management team is important if one would like to use the school's resources (such as our classrooms) for a group event such as a social meeting. <br> <sub>Disclaimer: measures are in place to ensure anyone who enters the school has the necessary approval from a present staff member to do so, and that all our school's entrances are monitored and regulated.</sub>

            <summary>NSNP</summary>
            <p>The National School Nutrition Programme is a joint effort by the national department oeducation, community members and the respective schools to ensure that all children a nourished throughout the day to better enhacne their learning potential. Our school provides breakfast and lunch to the learners each day from the school's kitchen. These meals are prepared and served by a group of parents according to national nutrition and health standards. Parents are thus further intergrated in the school as the providers of nutritious meals to children who ootherwise may not have had such.  </p>
